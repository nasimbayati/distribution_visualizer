# Distribution Visualizer CLI

This project provides a clean and modular visualization of statistical distributions using Python. It demonstrates the relationship between real-world data and theoretical statistical concepts using matplotlib.

## 📊 Visualizations
The program displays four subplots:

1. **Scatter Plot with Best-Fit Line**  
   Shows noisy linear data with a calculated best-fit regression line.

2. **Standard Normal Distribution (PDF)**  
   Plots the standard normal probability density function.

3. **Skewed Distribution Histogram**  
   Simulates a positively skewed dataset using a Gamma distribution.

4. **Standard Normal Distribution (CDF)**  
   Approximates and visualizes the cumulative distribution function.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Manual data generation
- Frequency histograms and PDFs
- Custom statistical functions
- Use of `matplotlib`, `random`, `math`, and `numpy`
- No third-party statistics libraries required for PDF or CDF logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

### Run the Script
```bash
python distribution_visualizer.py
```
